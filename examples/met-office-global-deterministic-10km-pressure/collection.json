  "description": " The flagship Numerical Weather Prediction model developed and used at the Met Office, is the Unified Model, the same model is used for both weather and climate prediction. For weather forecasting the Met Office runs several configurations of the Unified Model as part of its operational Numerical Weather Prediction suite. \n\nThe Global deterministic model is a global configuration of the Met Office Unified Models providing the most accurate short range deterministic forecast by any national meteorological service covering a six-day period. It can produce selected hourly data covering the first 48 hours at surface level and at standard pressure levels twice a day. The model\u2019s initial state is kept close to the real atmosphere using hybrid 4D-Var data assimilation. Uncovering 2 years\u2019 worth of historical data, updated regularly with a 4-hour time delay. Formatted via NetCDF. \n\n### Update Frequency Available time steps: every hour from 0 to 54 hours, every 3 hours between 57 to 144 hours and every 6 hours between 150 to 168 hours. Full runs (up to 168 hours): 00:00, 12:00. Shortened runs (up to 66 hours): 06:00, 18:00. ",
